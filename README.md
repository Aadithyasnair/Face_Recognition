# Face Detection and Recognition with Flask

This project is a Flask application that uses OpenCV, dlib, and face_recognition libraries to perform face detection and recognition. The application captures video from the user's camera, processes frames on the server, and displays the processed frames with face detection and recognition results.

## Features

- Live video stream from the user's camera
- Face detection using dlib and face_recognition
- Face recognition with a known face
- Stops processing once a match is found

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-flask.git
   cd face-detection-flask
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file:**

   Download the file from [here](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2) and extract it to the project directory.

5. **Place a known face image:**

   Place an image named `known_face.jpg` in the project directory. This image will be used for face recognition.

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser and go to:**

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

3. **Allow camera access:**

   When prompted, allow the web page to access your camera.

4. **View the live video feed:**

   The application will display the live video feed from your camera. It will perform face detection and recognition on the server and display the processed frames.

5. **Stop processing on match:**

   The application will stop processing frames once it finds a match with the known face.
